Supervised Learning Project

Description
This project demonstrates **Supervised Learning**, a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

Features
- Load and explore datasets
- Handle missing values and categorical features
- Train models using algorithms such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - kNN
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - R² Score (for regression)
- Visualize results using plots (scatter, ba
